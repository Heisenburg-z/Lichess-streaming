// This is a Tailwind CSS configuration file that specifies the content files to scan for class names and extends the default theme.
// It includes all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.
// The `extend` section is currently empty, meaning no custom styles or themes are added beyond the default Tailwind CSS setup.
